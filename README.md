# mini-patterns-and-deriving

This is my attempt at these two amazing blog posts:
* https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns
* https://kowainik.github.io/posts/deriving

I really like that they come with exercises, and this urged me to create this repository, to play with the ideas instead of peeping their answers.
