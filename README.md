# mini-patterns-and-deriving

This is my attempt at these two amazing blog posts:
* https://kowainik.github.io/posts/haskell-mini-patterns
* https://kowainik.github.io/posts/deriving

There is an entire episode in Haskell Weekly dedicated to the deriving article [here](https://haskellweekly.news/episode/25.html).

I really like that they come with exercises, and this urged me to create this repository, to play with the ideas instead of looking into their answers immediately without having thought too much about the problems.
